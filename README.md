Gesture-Controlled Volume using Hand Tracking
Control your system volume using simple hand gestures! This project uses Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pycaw to track your hand in real-time and adjust the volume based on the distance between your fingers.

📌 Features
✅ Real-time hand tracking with MediaPipe

✅ Gesture recognition (thumb & index finger distance)

✅ Smooth, distance-based volume control

✅ Live FPS counter

✅ Visual feedback (landmarks, connecting lines, volume bar)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
Python	Core programming language
OpenCV	Webcam video capture and processing
MediaPipe	Hand landmark detection & tracking
Pycaw	Windows audio control via Core Audio API

🚀 How It Works
OpenCV captures webcam frames.

MediaPipe detects 21 hand landmarks.

The distance between the thumb tip and index finger tip is calculated.

This distance is mapped to the system’s volume range using Pycaw.

OpenCV visualizes the hand, lines, circles, volume bar, and FPS.
